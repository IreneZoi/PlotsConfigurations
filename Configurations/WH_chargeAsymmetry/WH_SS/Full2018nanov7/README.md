# WH charge asymmetry analysis

This is an adaptation of the analysis which is part of HIG-20-013. It is used to measure the asymmetry in the prodution of W+H and W-H.

The instructions to run the analysis follow.

### Produce distributions using mkShapesMulti.py in batch mode

    mkShapesMulti.py --pycfg=configuration.py --doBatch=1 --batchSplit=Samples,Files --batchQueue=testmatch

Resubmit failed jobs.

    cd $HOME/scripts/jobs/mkShapes__ggH_SF_2018_v7/
    for i in *jid; do condor_submit ${i/jid/jds}; done
    cd -

Or, if they failed because the wall clock time has been exceeded, resubmit them on a longer-time queue.

    cd $HOME/scripts/jobs/mkShapes__ggH_SF_2018_v7/
    for i in *jid; do sed -i "s/longlunch/workday/g" ${i/jid/jds}; condor_submit ${i/jid/jds}; done
    cd -
